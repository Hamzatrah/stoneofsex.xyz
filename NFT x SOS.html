            Hamzat spent 5 years carving Stone of Sex, a marble sculpture composed of three gestures set in stone; touch, embrace and penetration. Soon after its first exhibition, he started destroying the sculpture. Luckily, a 3D scan of Stone of Sex was preserved.

These collaborations explore the conservation, preservation, and exhibition of Stone of Sex. The series engages and encourages a dialogue between traditional art media and the emergence of NFT Art.
